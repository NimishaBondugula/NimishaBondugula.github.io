            <h3> How does Samhitha conduct soil profile analysis? </h3>
            <p> Often overlooked but equally vital to plant growth as the topsoil, the subsoil plays a crucial role, especially for deep-rooted orchard crops. Understanding the properties of the subsoil is imperative in assessing soil reliability. Utilizing precision technologies, they delve beneath the surface, providing comprehensive insights into the soil's characteristics to a depth of one meter from the surface. This comprehensive analysis not only enhances their understanding of subsoil quality but also aids in predicting its influence on overall productivity. </p>

            <h3> The Adoption of Rainwater Harvesting and Groundwater Recharge </h3>
            <p>Orchard farming is a prevalent method, relying heavily on consistent rainfall and groundwater for irrigation. Yet, as summer arrives, orchard cultivators face mounting difficulties due to water shortages. This often results in reduced crop yields and fruit quality, and in severe cases, the gradual decline and eventual demise of mature orchards. Samhitha Crop Care Clinics advocates for the adoption of optimal rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge practices to address this pressing issue.</p>
